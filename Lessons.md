What this project taught me:

- Interaction between HTML and JS (using getElementById and QuerySelector)
- Event listeners
- Array and object methods
- Dynamically creating HTML elements in JS
- Local storage
  - When getting buttons from local storage, they don't have their event listeners
  - Only stores things as strings
