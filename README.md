# favorites-month-tracker

To do:

- Improve CSS
- Make it so you can only add one book, movie, and song per month
- Type in your username, retrieves your data instead of local storage
- Write description for website
- Testing
- Organizing code

Things I learned from doing this

- Interaction between HTML and JS (using getElementById and QuerySelector)
- Event listeners
- Array and object methods
- Dynamically creating HTML elements in JS
- Local storage
  - When getting buttons from local storage, they don't have their event listeners
